- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
- Server-side Routing & Middlewear

- [ ] Describe Middleware?
- 3rd party applications/libraries that allow us to add functionality to our application.

- [ ] Describe a Resource?
- an object that returns value. It can be referred to pull information.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
- HTTP status code of 200.

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
- Index can comtain the port to listen to. The Server can contain the middleware and routes. Then in it's body it can contain the routes pulled in from the subroutes.
